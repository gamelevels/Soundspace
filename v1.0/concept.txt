Soundspace (remake) is a rhythm game, where you have to hit notes consecutively without missing more than 5 times

Maps will be stored in the following pattern:

map_id,note,note,note.....

note:
    (X | Y | Delay (MS))
    X - (0,0), (1,0), (2,0)
    Y - (0,0), (0,1), (0,2)
    Delay - MS since song has started before displaying

There's a 3x3 grid centered in the screen
Notes will spawn in any of the areas in the grid

There will be notes called Quantum notes
These will not spawn on a 3x3 grid, they will have an X/Y offset multiplier

example
        -0.2|1.4|55,1.1|-2.1|155
